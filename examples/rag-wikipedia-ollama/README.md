# RAG Wikipedia Ollama

This example shows a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application, using `chromem-go` as knowledge base for finding relevant info for a question. More specifically the app is doing *question answering*. The underlying data is 200 Wikipedia articles (or rather their lead section / introduction).

We run the embeddings model and LLM in [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), to showcase how a RAG application can run entirely offline, without relying on OpenAI or other third party APIs. It doesn't require a GPU, and a CPU like an 11th Gen Intel i5-1135G7 (like in the first generation Framework Laptop 13) is fast enough.

As LLM we use Google's [Gemma (2B)](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b), a very small model that doesn't need much resources and is fast, but doesn't have much knowledge, so it's a prime example for the combination of LLMs and vector databases. We found Gemma 2B to be superior to [TinyLlama (1.1B)](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0), [Stable LM 2 (1.6B)](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b) and [Phi-2 (2.7B)](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) for the RAG use case.

As embeddings model we use Nomic's [nomic-embed-text v1.5](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5).

## How to run

1. Install Ollama: <https://ollama.com/download>
2. Download the two models:
   - `ollama pull gemma:2b`
   - `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. Run the example: `go run .`

## Output

The output can differ slightly on each run, but it's along the lines of:

```log

```

The majority of the time here is spent during the embeddings creation, where we are limited by the performance of the Ollama API, which depends on your CPU/GPU and the embeddings model.

## OpenAI

You can easily adapt the code to work with OpenAI instead of locally in Ollama.

Add the OpenAI API key in your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Then, if you want to create the embeddings via OpenAI, but still use Gemma 2B as LLM:
