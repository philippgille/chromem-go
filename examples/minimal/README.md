# Minimal example

This is a minimal example that shows how `chromem-go` works. For more sophisticated examples that use the persistent DB, locally running embedding models, a basic RAG pipeline, with more explanations in the README as well as code comments, check the other examples!

## How to run

1. Set the OpenAI API key in your env as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Run the example: `go run .`
