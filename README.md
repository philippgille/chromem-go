# chromem-go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/philippgille/chromem-go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/philippgille/chromem-go)

In-memory vector database for Go with Chroma-like interface and zero third-party dependencies.

It's not a library to connect to the Chroma database. It's an in-memory database on its own, meant to enable retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications in Go *without having to run a separate database*.  
As such, the focus is not scale or performance, but simplicity.

> ⚠️ The initial implementation is fairly naive, with only the bare minimum in features. But over time we'll improve and extend it.

## Interface

Our inspiration, the [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) interface, is the following (taken from their [README](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/blob/0.4.21/README.md)).

```python
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection("all-my-documents")

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=["This is document1", "This is document2"], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{"source": "notion"}, {"source": "google-docs"}], # filter on these!
    ids=["doc1", "doc2"], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["This is a query document"],
    n_results=2,
    # where={"metadata_field": "is_equal_to_this"}, # optional filter
    # where_document={"$contains":"search_string"}  # optional filter
)
```

Our Go library exposes the same interface:

```go
package main

import "github.com/philippgille/chromem-go"

func main() {
    // Set up chromem-go in-memory, for easy prototyping. Persistence will be added in the future.
    client := chromem.NewClient()

    // Create collection. GetCollection, GetOrCreateCollection, DeleteCollection will be added in the future.
    collection := client.CreateCollection("all-my-documents", nil, nil)

    // Add docs to the collection. Update and delete will be added in the future.
    // Row-based API will be added when Chroma adds it!
    _ = collection.Add(ctx,
        []string{"doc1", "doc2"}, // unique ID for each doc
        nil, // We handle embedding automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well.
        []map[string]string{{"source": "notion"}, {"source": "google-docs"}}, // Filter on these!
        []string{"This is document1", "This is document2"},
    )

    // Query/search 2 most similar results. Getting by ID will be added in the future.
    results, _ := collection.Query(ctx,
        "This is a query document",
        2,
        map[string]string{"metadata_field": "is_equal_to_this"}, // optional filter
        map[string]string{"$contains": "search_string"},         // optional filter
    )
}
```

Initially, only a minimal subset of all of Chroma's interface is implemented or exported, but we'll add more in future versions.

## Inspirations

- Shoutout to [@eliben](https://github.com/eliben) whose [blog post](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2023/retrieval-augmented-generation-in-go/) and [example code](https://github.com/eliben/code-for-blog/tree/eda87b87dad9ed8bd45d1c8d6395efba3741ed39/2023/go-rag-openai) inspired me to start this project!
- [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma): Looking at Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate and others, Chroma stood out by showing its core API in 4 commands on their README and on the landing page of their website. It was also one of the few ones with an in-memory mode (for Python).
